# Objective
Can you develop a model of machine learning that can predict  the salaries of baseball players?

The goal is to estimate a baseball player's salary.

# Details about the dataset
This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. This is part of the data that was used in the 1988 ASA Graphics Section Poster Session. The salary data were originally from Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987. The 1986 and career statistics were obtained from The 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York.

# Results

* **Linear Regression:**

Based on the operations performed, Ridge Regression gave the lowest error. Ridge: 183.457

* **Nonlinear Regression:**

The model created as a result of GBM Hyperparameter optimization became the model with the lowest RMSE value. GBM: 114
